# Programming Playground

I love learning new programming languages. Here you'll find various programs that I write in order to learn and better understand a programming language. Many might not be the "best way", but that's not the point. The goal is just to learn the basics that in the future I can try to master if I wish.

## Problems

Here's a list of "programs" I'll be writing. You can use this list too!

1. **Linked Lists**
   - I think implementing linked lists is usually a good way to learn a new programming language because it exposes you to syntax, structures, loops, conditions, class/functions, generics (if any), amongst other in the given language.

2. **Guessing Number**
   - Generate a random number 0 to 100 then try to guess it in 5 tries. Store score to keep track of high score in a file. This will expose you to cli and input along with ranges/loops, comparisons, and I/O file operations.

## Running

Each file has instructions as a comment on how to run (and compile if needed)
